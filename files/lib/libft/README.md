# Libft

The aim of this project is to code a C library regrouping usual functions that Iâ€™ll be allowed to use in all my other projects.

## Installation
It will compile with flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -I -c`


Type `make` to compile the functions and now you can use ***libft.a***
  
  If you want to eliminate .o files type `make clean` and all files will disappear.
  
  For any doubt use the command `man [name_of_function]`
